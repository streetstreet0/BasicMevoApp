# Description

This project queries Mevo's public API's and displays the location of vehicles in wellington as pin markers on a map. It also displays the Mevo parking zones.
This project was meant to use MapBox for the map, but I had to use Osmroid instead due to certain limitations (metioned privately).

# Installation

The project can be compiled in Android Studio and ran on a virtual machine running Android version 10.0 or newer. It was developed specifically for a Pixel 2 API 30, more recent versions have not been tested. In a future update, a runnable apk.

# Project Status

There is only one feature left to be added: A runnable apk file. After this is developed, the project will be finished and closed.
